# LizzieYzy Next-FoxUID

**An actively maintained LizzieYzy fork that restores broken Fox Weiqi sync and ships practical KataGo-ready releases for Windows, macOS, and Linux.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The original Fox sync flow in LizzieYzy no longer worked reliably. This fork restores it and standardizes the UI around Fox ID input.

## Why This Fork Exists

The original LizzieYzy is still useful, but one of its most important flows no longer worked reliably: syncing Fox kifu. This fork focuses on making the project usable again, not just preserving history.

What changed:

- **Fox sync fixed** with a newer Fox H5 API based flow
- **Fox ID only** so users no longer need to guess whether to use a name or an internal UID
- **Cleaner releases** so people can quickly choose the right package
- **Ongoing maintenance** instead of a one-off patch

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why remove username lookup?</strong></summary>

Because it caused confusion and was less reliable for maintenance. Fox ID is clearer for both users and debugging.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why keep dmg files but remove macOS app.zip from releases?</strong></summary>

Because most users want a direct installer workflow, not two macOS package formats that look similar.
