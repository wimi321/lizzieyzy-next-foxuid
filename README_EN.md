# LizzieYzy Next-FoxUID

**An actively maintained LizzieYzy fork focused on restoring broken Fox sync, standardizing the workflow around Fox ID, and shipping clearer multi-platform KataGo releases.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The original Fox sync flow in LizzieYzy no longer worked reliably. This fork restores it and standardizes the UI around **Fox ID** input.

## What This Fork Fixes

`LizzieYzy Next-FoxUID` is a maintained fork of the original `lizzieyzy` project.

This repository is not a rewrite. It keeps the original LizzieYzy usable for the parts people still rely on.

The main goals are straightforward:

- install it without guesswork
- fetch public Fox games by **Fox ID**
- continue with KataGo review

This fork mainly fixes these problems:

- the original Fox sync flow stopped working for many users
- UI and docs mixed Fox ID, UID, and username wording
- release packages were harder than they should be to choose from
- install and troubleshooting information was scattered

## If You Just Want To Start

| What you need right now | Go here |
| --- | --- |
| A package that works out of the box | Go to [Releases](https://github.com/wimi321/lizzieyzy-next-foxuid/releases) and choose a `with-katago` package |
| A package for custom engine setup | Read [Package Overview](docs/PACKAGES_EN.md) and choose a `without.engine` package |
| Real-world platform verification status | Read [Tested Platforms](docs/TESTED_PLATFORMS.md) |
| Install or first-launch help | Read [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL_EN.md) and [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_EN.md) |
| Report install success or failure | Use the [Installation Report template](https://github.com/wimi321/lizzieyzy-next-foxuid/issues/new?template=installation_report.yml) |
| Report a bug or suggest an improvement | Use [Issues](https://github.com/wimi321/lizzieyzy-next-foxuid/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/wimi321/lizzieyzy-next-foxuid/discussions) |

## Screenshot

The current UI now presents the old confusing UID entry as a clearer Fox sync entry based on **Fox ID**, while keeping the familiar LizzieYzy review workflow around it.

## Which Package To Download

> [!TIP]
> For most users, the right choice is simple: pick a `with-katago` package. Only choose `without.engine` if you already know you want to manage the engine yourself.

## Typical Flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/start-flow.svg" alt="LizzieYzy Next-FoxUID Start Flow" width="100%" />
</p>

For most users, the path is straightforward:

1. Download the package for your system, usually `with-katago`
2. Launch the app and open the Fox sync entry
3. Enter a numeric **Fox ID** to fetch the latest public games
4. Continue with bundled or custom KataGo review

## Quick Start

1. Download the package for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/wimi321/lizzieyzy-next-foxuid/releases) page.
2. If you want the shortest path, choose a `with-katago` package.
3. Launch the app and open the Fox sync entry.
4. Enter a numeric **Fox ID** to fetch the latest public Fox games.
5. If your OS blocks the first launch, check the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL_EN.md) and [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_EN.md).

## What You Can Do With It

| Use case | Available capability |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch games | Pull the latest public Fox games by Fox ID |
| Review a game | Hawk Eye charts, winrate swings, score swings, mistake tracking |
| Fast analysis | Parallel whole-game analysis with KataGo analysis mode |
| Batch workflows | Analyze multiple SGFs in one run |
| Engine comparison | Dual-engine mode and engine-vs-engine matches |
| Local study | Tsumego and local-shape analysis helpers |
| Other retained workflows | Board sync, rough territory judgment, and other commonly used original features |

## Compared With The Original Project

| Topic | Original LizzieYzy | Next-FoxUID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fox sync | Broken for many users | Restored |
| Input naming | Mixed UID / username wording | Fox ID only |
| Release layout | Harder to choose from | Reorganized by platform and use case |
| macOS distribution | More confusing historical package mix | `.dmg` first, separated by Apple Silicon / Intel |
| Windows x64 strategy | Less clear package split | Keeps both `with-katago` and `without.engine` |
| Maintenance | Mostly inactive | Actively maintained as a fork |

## If You Are Migrating From The Original Project

- The Fox sync entry is now consistently described as a Fox ID based flow
- Username lookup is no longer part of the supported path
- Windows x64 still keeps both `with-katago` and `without.engine`
- macOS releases are centered on `.dmg` installers instead of extra `.app.zip` assets
- This repository is intended for continued maintenance, not a temporary hotfix drop

## Bundled Engine Details

| Item | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| KataGo version | `v1.16.4` |
| Default bundled weight | `g170e-b20c256x2-s5303129600-d1228401921.bin.gz` |

Paths:

- Windows / Linux weight path: `Lizzieyzy/weights/default.bin.gz`
- macOS weight path: `LizzieYzy Next-FoxUID.app/Contents/app/weights/default.bin.gz`
- On macOS, if Finder only shows a single `.app`, that is expected. Use “Show Package Contents” to inspect the bundled files.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why remove username lookup?</strong></summary>

Because it caused confusion and was harder to maintain. Fox ID is clearer for users and easier to debug.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why keep dmg files but remove macOS app.zip from releases?</strong></summary>

Because most users want a direct installer workflow, not multiple macOS package formats that look similar.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why keep both with-katago and without.engine for Windows x64?</strong></summary>

Because these serve two different audiences: one wants a bundled setup, the other wants to manage engines manually.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the relationship between this fork and the original author?</strong></summary>

This is a maintained fork built on the original project. The goal is not to replace the original author, but to continue maintaining the broken workflows and release experience after the original project became inactive.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if my platform does not have a real-machine verification record yet?</strong></summary>

Check [Tested Platforms](docs/TESTED_PLATFORMS.md) first, then follow the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL_EN.md). If you can report either a successful install or a failure, that directly improves the project.
</details>
