  <strong>A maintained LizzieYzy build that works again for everyday Fox use.</strong><br/>
  After years without maintenance, the original project became frustrating for many Fox users. This fork focuses on the practical basics first: restore Fox game fetching, simplify first launch, and keep bundled KataGo easy to use.<br/>
  <strong>Download it, enter a Fox nickname, and keep reviewing.</strong>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Start with these 5 points:
> - Most Windows users should download `windows64.with-katago.installer.exe`, the recommended **CPU build**
> - If you specifically want to try OpenCL GPU acceleration, download `windows64.opencl.installer.exe`
> - If your PC has an **NVIDIA GPU** and you want faster analysis, download `windows64.nvidia.installer.exe`
> - You can now enter a **Fox nickname** directly. The app resolves the account and fetches recent public games automatically.
> - The recommended bundles already include KataGo and try to finish the first-launch setup automatically.

This repository stays focused on a few practical goals:

- keep the LizzieYzy workflow alive for people who still use it every day
- keep Fox game fetching, bundled KataGo, and release packages usable for normal users
- reduce setup friction instead of assuming everyone wants to build a custom environment

## Windows Users Start Here

If you are on **Windows**:

- Most users should start with **`windows64.with-katago.installer.exe`**, the more stable **CPU build**
- If you specifically want to try **OpenCL GPU acceleration**, choose **`windows64.opencl.installer.exe`**
- If your PC has an **NVIDIA GPU** and you care about speed first, choose **`windows64.nvidia.installer.exe`**

These give you a CPU build, an OpenCL build, and an NVIDIA-specific build.
On first launch, the NVIDIA bundle now prepares the required official NVIDIA runtime files automatically in the user folder before starting accelerated analysis.
The CPU build, the OpenCL build, and the NVIDIA build can all use `KataGo Auto Setup -> Smart Optimize`.

## What To Download

If you prefer a visual chooser first, start with this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/package-guide.svg" alt="LizzieYzy Next package guide" width="100%" />
</p>

| Your computer | Download this |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64, CPU build, recommended | `windows64.with-katago.installer.exe` |
| Windows x64, CPU build, no installer | `windows64.with-katago.portable.zip` |
| Windows x64, OpenCL build, try GPU acceleration | `windows64.opencl.installer.exe` |
| Windows x64, OpenCL build, no installer | `windows64.opencl.portable.zip` |
| Windows x64, NVIDIA GPU, faster analysis | `windows64.nvidia.installer.exe` |
| Windows x64, NVIDIA GPU, no installer | `windows64.nvidia.portable.zip` |
| Windows x64, your own engine with installer | `windows64.without.engine.installer.exe` |
| Windows x64, your own engine | `windows64.without.engine.portable.zip` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `mac-arm64.with-katago.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | `mac-amd64.with-katago.dmg` |
| Linux x64 | `linux64.with-katago.zip` |

Quick rule:

- Windows: if you are not sure what to choose, use `windows64.with-katago.installer.exe`
- Mac: choose Apple Silicon or Intel first
- Linux: choose `with-katago.zip`

At a glance:

- `with-katago.installer.exe`: recommended CPU build for most Windows users
- `opencl.installer.exe`: OpenCL build for people who specifically want to try OpenCL GPU acceleration
- `nvidia.installer.exe`: Windows NVIDIA bundle for higher KataGo speed
- `opencl.portable.zip`: unzip-and-run OpenCL build
- `nvidia.portable.zip`: unzip-and-run NVIDIA build
- `with-katago.portable.zip`: unzip-and-run CPU build
- `without.engine.installer.exe`: for people who want installer flow but their own engine
- `without.engine.portable.zip`: for people who already manage their own engine and do not want installation

## Why This Fork Is Worth Looking At

- **It fixes the part that stopped the original build from being useful**
  Many users could no longer fetch Fox games at all. This fork restores that workflow first.
- **It asks for the information users actually know**
  Enter the Fox nickname you already know. The app resolves the matching account automatically.
- **It keeps the familiar LizzieYzy workflow, with less setup pain**
  The main bundled packages already include KataGo and a default weight, so most users can open the app and start reviewing faster.
- **It adds a smarter performance path instead of leaving tuning to guesswork**
  `KataGo Auto Setup` now includes Smart Optimize, which runs KataGo's official benchmark flow and writes back a better thread setting automatically.

## Start In 3 Steps

1. Download the right package from [Releases](https://github.com/wimi321/lizzieyzy-next/releases).
2. Open **Fox Kifu (search by nickname)**.
3. Enter a Fox nickname, fetch the latest visible public games, and continue reviewing.

## Actual Interface

This is the current maintained build interface, not an old historical screenshot. The bottom toolbar now exposes practical entries such as **Fox Kifu** and **Update Official Weight** directly.

</p>

The main day-to-day actions are now visible on the main window instead of being buried first:

| What you want to do | What you can click right away |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch recent public Fox games | `Fox Kifu` |
| Update official KataGo weights | `Update Official Weight` |
| Keep reviewing with AI | `Kata review` / `Auto analysis` |
| Stay on the main workflow | fewer detours into setup-heavy dialogs |

## What The Bundled Packages Already Include

| Item | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| KataGo version | `v1.16.4` |
| Default weight | `g170e-b20c256x2-s5303129600-d1228401921.bin.gz` |
| First-launch auto setup | Enabled |
| Official weight download entry | Included |

For most people, the main takeaway is simple:

**The bundled packages already include KataGo and a default weight, so you can usually open the app and start reviewing right away.**

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need the Fox account number first?</strong></summary>

No. Enter the Fox nickname you already know. The app resolves the matching account automatically, and the game list still shows both nickname and account number so you can confirm the result.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why switch to nickname input?</strong></summary>

Because normal users usually know the nickname, not the account number. This maintained fork moves the lookup step into the app so the workflow feels natural again.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What should I check if no games are found?</strong></summary>

Check whether the nickname is correct, whether that account has recent public games, and whether there is a temporary network issue. Empty results are normal when the account has no visible public games.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I still need to configure KataGo by hand?</strong></summary>

Most `with-katago` users do not. The app now tries to detect bundled KataGo, bundled weights, and the right config path automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if macOS blocks the app on first launch?</strong></summary>

Current macOS builds are not signed or notarized yet. If macOS blocks the app the first time, follow the steps in the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL_EN.md).
